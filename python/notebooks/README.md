# ZPIC Examples

In this folder you can find example Jupyter notebooks using ZPIC. If you haven't, make sure you start with the [ZPIC](tutorial/ZPIC.ipynb) notebook that covers the basic usage of ZPIC in these environments.

 These examples are organized over 3 directories as follows:

* `tutorial` - Notebooks introducing code usage and functionalities;
* `classroom` - Examples of ZPIC notebooks that can be used in a classroom to showcase some of the most fundamental plasma physics phenomena;
* `papers` - Notebooks reproducing and extending the work done in seminal plasma physics papers.
